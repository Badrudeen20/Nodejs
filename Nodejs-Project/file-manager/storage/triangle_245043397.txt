Area of Triangle
One of the properties of a triangle is its area, which is the region covered by the three-sided polygon in a plane. The formula for any triangle’s area is given by;

Area of a Triangle = ½ × Base × Height

One more formula has been introduced by a Mathematician, which is known as Heron’s Formula. This formula is used when the sides of the triangles are known to us. It is given by;

Area of Triangle-Heron's Formula

Where ‘s’ is the semi-perimeter of the triangle and given by;

s = (a+b+c)/2
